# AWS Elastic Beanstalk CI/CD with CodePipeline & Route 53

This project demonstrates a **fully automated deployment pipeline** for a web application using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **AWS CodePipeline**, **GitHub**, and **Amazon Route 53** for domain management.  

Whenever new code is pushed to the GitHub repository, CodePipeline automatically builds and deploys it to Elastic Beanstalk. The application is accessible through a custom domain configured in Route 53.

## üîß Project Architecture

1. **GitHub (Source Control)**
   - Stores the website/application source code.
   - Any push to the main branch triggers the pipeline.

2. **AWS CodePipeline (CI/CD Orchestrator)**
   - Detects changes in GitHub.
   - Automatically delivers the new version to Elastic Beanstalk.

3. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Hosting Platform)**
   - Deploys and manages the application.
   - Provides auto-scaling and load balancing.
  
4. **Amazon Route 53** 
   - Provides custom domain name mapping to the Beanstalk environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

-**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** ‚Äì Application hosting & scaling  
- **AWS CodePipeline** ‚Äì Continuous integration & deployment (CI/CD)  
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Source code repository & version control  
- **Amazon Route 53** ‚Äì Domain name system (DNS) management

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Code Push to GitHub**  
   - Developer commits and pushes changes to the GitHub repository.  

2. **CodePipeline Triggers**  
   - AWS CodePipeline detects the new commit via the GitHub connection.  
   - Pipeline automatically starts the deployment process.   

3. **Deployment to Elastic Beanstalk**  
   - Elastic Beanstalk deploys the latest build to the environment.  
   - The application is now live and automatically scaled based on traffic.  

4. **Route 53 Domain Mapping**  
   - A custom domain managed by Amazon Route 53 points to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.  
   - Users can access the app directly through `https://yourdomain.com`.  

**Flow Summary:**  
`GitHub (source code) ‚ûù CodePipeline (CI/CD) ‚ûù Elastic Beanstalk (hosting) ‚ûù Route 53 (custom domain)`

## üîë Key Benefits

1. **Automated Deployments**
    ‚Äì No manual intervention needed; every GitHub push is deployed automatically.  
2. **Scalability**
    ‚Äì Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles scaling based on application load.  
3. **Custom Domain Integration**
    ‚Äì Route 53 provides a professional, easy-to-remember domain name.  
4. **Reduced Downtime**
    ‚Äì Blue/Green or Rolling updates in Beanstalk minimize downtime during deployments.  
5. **Centralized Pipeline**
    ‚Äì CodePipeline provides a single place to manage CI/CD.  
6. **Cost-Effective**
    ‚Äì Pay only for the AWS resources you use, with built-in monitoring and logging.  
7. **Flexibility**
    ‚Äì Works with multiple programming languages (Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, etc.).  
8. **Secure**
    ‚Äì Integrated with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control and GitHub connection security.
